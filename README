== Test script to show that lib::abs does not work with symlinks

There is a great perl module lib::abs:

https://metacpan.org/module/lib::abs
https://github.com/Mons/lib-abs

But it does not work properly with symlinks. I hope that it can be fixed.

Here is the steps to reproduce the error.

    $ git clone https://github.com/bessarabov/lib-abs-symlink-problem.git
    $ cd lib-abs-symlink-problem
    $ cp -r script/ app/

The file structure will be:

    $ tree
    .
    |-- app
    |   |-- lib
    |   |   |-- b
    |   |   |   `-- Bar.pm
    |   |   `-- Foo.pm
    |   `-- script
    |       |-- both.pl
    |       |-- lib-b-bar.pl
    |       `-- lib-foo.pl
    `-- script
        |-- both.pl
        |-- lib-b-bar.pl
        `-- lib-foo.pl

In this case the script works as expected:

    $ cd app/script/
    $ ./both.pl
    Foo
    Bar
    $ ./lib-foo.pl
    Foo
    $ ./lib-b-bar.pl
    Bar

But if there is a simlink the script does not work:

    $ rm -rf app/script/
    $ ln -s ~/sample/script/ app/
    $ tree
    .
    |-- app
    |   |-- lib
    |   |   |-- b
    |   |   |   `-- Bar.pm
    |   |   `-- Foo.pm
    |   `-- script -> /home/bessarabov/sample/script/
    `-- script
        |-- both.pl
        |-- lib-b-bar.pl
        `-- lib-foo.pl

    $ ./both.pl
    Bad path specification: `../lib/b' => `/home/bessarabov/sample/script/../lib/b' (No such file or directory) at ./both.pl line 5
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./both.pl line 5.

    $ ./lib-foo.pl
